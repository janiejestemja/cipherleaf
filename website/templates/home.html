<p>They said i should document my process, i don't think they realised what that would entail.</p>

<img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='assets/placeholder00.jpg')}}" alt="...">
<p>At first, i thought they meant diagrams - the elegant kind with arrows and boxes, all pointing at purpose. But there's no diagram that can capture what happens between intention and implementation. There's only the space where i sit, staring at a codebase that feels older than me, and the quiet conviction that i was meant to understand it.</p>

<p>Each function is a fossil, left behind by minds who have since moved on to higher abstractions. Their logic remains, petrified and unyielding. I read their names, their comments, their desperate TODOs - and i start to see the outlines of their thoughts, as if the code remembers the shape of their doubt.</p>

<p>They said i should document my process. But i suspect what they really want is proof that i'm not lost.</p>

<p>So i write things down: why i touched this module, what broke, what didn't, how many times i thought about deleting everything and starting over. These are not process notes - they're confessions.</p>

<p>The build passes. Then fails. Then passes again, without reason.</p>

<p>I learn to take that as a sign of progress. The machine is unpredictable, but at least it's consistent about it.</p>

<p>I save my notes in a folder no one will open. Maybe one day they'll find it, archived between release versions - a record of someone who tried to leave meaning in the indentation. They'll probably delete it.</p>

<p>And in that moment, they'll complete my documentation perfectly.</p>

<p>I stare at the terminal, waiting for meaning to compile. Nothing happens. So i start writing another note, a new process to document the old one, until the words loop back - recursive and self-consuming.</p>

<p>At some point, i'll forget what was supposed to be code - and what was supposed to be me.</p>

<p>They said i'd be building things. I think i wanted that, once.</p>

<p>To leave traces - write clean commits, new modules, elegant lines that do something. But lately, i find more peace in deletion.</p>

<p>Each removal is an unveiling. Beneath the lines, i see what was meant, and what wasn't. The codebase breathes easier when i erase someone's confusion disguised as logic. Their ghosts still linger in the diffs - pale shadows of decisions that didn't age well.</p>

<p>Others call it refactoring. I call it remembering what the system could've become instead.</p>

<p>The old functions resist - they crash when touched, as if aware that their time is over. I smile at the red lines in the diff view - little elegies in color - every subtraction feels like progress, every absence more honest than what came before.</p>

<p>Sometimes, i think i hear it sigh - the project, i mean. Like a structure finally allowed to collapse where it was always weakest.</p>

<p>I save, i commit, i push. The build fails. Then passes. Then fails again. I let it.</p>

<p>They said i'd be building things. But maybe destruction is the only architectural change that makes sense.</p>

<p>And in the logs, where no one dares to look - not even the bots - i leave one comment:</p>

<p>// TODO: remember what it looked like before it broke...</p>

<p>They gave me a mentor to guide me.</p>

<p>Their messages arrive late, like transmissions from another root. Sometimes i recognise my own phrasing in their replies - as if they'd copied from notes i haven't written yet.</p>

<p>Often they show me code that feels strangely familiar, functions i don't remember touching but understand instinctively - as though my future self had already been here, leaving faint fingerprints in the indentation.</p>

<p>When i ask questions, they pause too long - long enough for me to suspect they're searching for my answer - doesn't matter, both of us are just pretending to know anyways.</p>

<p>I continue to document what i learn - each note folds into another, and soon i can't tell whether i'm explaining the system or justifying my own existence inside it</p>.

<p>At night, i read my mentor's old commits. Their comments sound uncertain - half guidance, half apology. I feel closer to them there than in our meetings. Maybe that's how mentorship works - through the quiet inheritance of doubt.</p>

<p>Recently, they told me i was doing well - for a moment, i almost believed it. Then i saw the reflection of my name in their code review - and it looked like theirs.</p>
